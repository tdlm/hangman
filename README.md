hangman
=======

This is a very simple version of hangman. The back-end logic has been separated completely from the front-end logic.

Installation
=======

This requires PHP 5.4+ to run properly.

To install:

    git clone git@github.com:tdlm/hangman.git

Once you've copied the directory to your webroot, you'll have to set up a local hostname in your web server of choice.
